Quality grading of the Areca plate using CNN

This is on of the realworld project .There is no existing project done related to Areca plates

Existing System:Quality grading of areca plate will be done manually it take much effort and poor segregation plates

proposed system:System aims to automates the quality grading of plates using CNN


#Introduction:
*Alternate To plastics/polymer based products and also paper based product
*Biodegradable plates are gaining poularity
*Biodegradable paltes are environmetal friendly
*It's made up of 100% natural mechanisms 


Woring procedure:

Usally plates are classified into 3 grades i.e class a,class b,class c.

* collect the data
* preprocessing techniques
* Choose the Model Mobilenet
* Train the model
* save the model
* Predict the model
* Flask framework



final outcome:
When we Give image in the website It will going to classify that plates will belong to which category either A ,B,C
